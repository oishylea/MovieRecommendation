# Movie Recommendation System 🎞️

A movie recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that seeks to predict the preference a user would give to a movie. These systems are widely used in various applications, such as movies, books, music, news, and products. This project uses a content-based recommendation system to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.  For this project, I have used the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) from Kaggle. <br>

### What is a recommendation system? 🔎

Types :
1. Content-based <br>
   Recommend items similar to the ones a user has liked in the past by analyzing the item's content (e.g., genres, keywords, plot summary) and making recommendations based on the user's preferences.<br>
   
2. Collaborative filtering based <br>
    Recommend items based on the preferences of similar users by identifying users with similar tastes and recommend items that these similar users have liked. <br>
    
3. Hybrid based<br>
  Provide more personalized and accurate recommendations by taking advantage of both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.<br>
